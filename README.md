# Hospital Database Management Project

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project is my way of proving to myself that I can use various SQL statements and 
queries in the MySQL database. I also used advanced Python loops to help automate insert 
processes when building the database used in this project. As a result, some finer details
may not be accurate such as the correlation of treatment to diagnosis, but I did my best to
focus on and showcase my expertise in SQL.

<h2>Tools</h2>

- SQL
- Python
- MySQL Workbench
- VSCode
